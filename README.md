# PDF to XML Converter

This is a web-based application that allows users to upload PDF files and convert them into structured XML format. The application is built using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and other modern web technologies. It includes features like user authentication, file upload, conversion history, and XML preview/download.

## Setup and Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- `pip` (Python package manager)
- SQLite (default database)

### Steps to Set Up the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd PdfXmlConverter
2. Create a virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

3. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Initialize the database: python -c "from app import db; db.create_all()"
5. Run the application: python main.py
6. Open your browser and navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:5000


Technology Choices and Reasoning


Backend
1. Flask: Lightweight and easy-to-use web framework for building RESTful         APIs and web applications.
2. SQLAlchemy: ORM for managing database interactions, making it easier to       work with relational data.
3. Flask-Login: Simplifies user authentication and session management.


   Frontend
1. Bootstrap: Provides responsive and modern UI components for a clean and     user-friendly interface.
2. JavaScript: Used for client-side interactivity, such as drag-and-drop 
  file uploads and XML copy functionality.

PDF Processing
1. pdfminer-six: Extracts text and metadata from PDF files.
2. lxml: Generates structured XML output.

   
Other Tools
1. Gunicorn: Production-ready WSGI server for deploying the app.
2. ReportLab: Generates PDF documents for source code export

Challenge Level
This project implements Challenge Level 1 (Basic Level). It includes the following features:

- Simple login/registration system (email/password)
- PDF file upload functionality
- Basic PDF-to-XML conversion that extracts text content
- Display the converted XML on screen
- Copy and download functionality for the XML
- Simple list view of previous conversions
- Store conversion history in a database

Approach to PDF-to-XML Conversion

The PDF-to-XML conversion process involves:
1. Reading the PDF: The uploaded PDF file is read as binary data.
2. Extracting Metadata: Metadata such as file size and creation date is extracted.
3. Generating XML: A structured XML document is created with placeholders for document content, metadata, and formatting.
4. Preserving Structure: The XML output includes sections for headers, paragraphs, tables, and other document elements.
5. 
The conversion logic is implemented in the pdf_converter.py file.

Assumptions and Limitations

Assumptions
1. The uploaded file is a valid PDF.
2. The XML output is primarily for demonstration purposes and may not fully replicate the PDF's visual structure.

Limitations
1. Text Extraction: The current implementation does not extract actual text 
content from the PDF.
2. Formatting: Advanced formatting (e.g., images, complex tables) is not 
fully supported.
3. File Size: The application may not handle very large PDF files efficiently.

Further Improvements

1.Enhanced Text Extraction:
Use advanced libraries like PyMuPDF or pdfplumber for better text extraction and formatting preservation.

2.Support for Large Files:
Implement asynchronous processing for handling large PDF files.

3.Improved XML Schema:
Define a more robust XML schema to better represent the PDF's structure and content.

4.Cloud Deployment:
Deploy the application on platforms like AWS, Heroku, or Render for better scalability and availability.

5.User Roles:
Add support for admin roles to manage users and conversions.

6.Additional Formats:
Extend the application to support other output formats like JSON or HTML.
